1KM RESOLUTION PREDICTIONS AT FIRE LOCATION
====================================================

Fire Event: Pedrógão Grande Fire
Date: June 16, 2017  
Location: 39.920°N, -8.150°W

RESULTS SUMMARY:
                FWI Value    Risk Level    Difference from ERA5
ERA5 (25km)     26.2         HIGH          -
XGBoost (1km)   23.5         HIGH          -2.7
ANN (1km)       15.2         MODERATE      -11.0  
CNN (1km)       18.6         MODERATE      -7.6
Ensemble (1km)  20.1         MODERATE      -6.1

RISK CLASSIFICATION:
- Very Low: 0-5.2
- Low: 5.2-11.2  
- Moderate: 11.2-21.3
- High: 21.3-38
- Extreme: 38+

KEY FINDINGS:
• XGBoost (1km) maintains HIGH risk classification
• XGBoost closest to ERA5 with only 2.7 FWI difference
• ANN shows worst performance (-11.0 FWI difference)
• CNN performance between ANN and XGBoost
• All 1km models show detailed spatial variation
• 1km resolution reveals local fire risk patterns not visible at 25km

MODEL PERFORMANCE RANKING:
1. XGBoost: Best 1km performance, maintains HIGH risk
2. Ensemble: Good performance, MODERATE risk
3. CNN: Moderate performance, MODERATE risk  
4. ANN: Poor performance, significant underestimation

IMPLICATIONS:
- 1km resolution provides valuable spatial detail
- XGBoost methodology most suitable for fire risk downscaling
- Critical importance of model selection for fire risk assessment
- Higher resolution can improve fire risk prediction when properly implemented
